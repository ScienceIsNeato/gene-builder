# Training Set

Hand-curated gene examples used to validate and improve the algorithm.

## How to Add a Gene

1.  **Create a folder**: `mkdir genes/YOUR_GENE`
2.  **Add files**:
    *   The `.gbk` file(s) you manually created/verified.
    *   Any notes on why you made those decisions (text file, markdown, whatever works).
    *   Optional: Screenshots if helpful.

## Current Examples

*   **lrfn1**: Simple case, 2 transcripts.

## Goal

Collect 5-10 diverse examples covering common patterns. These serve as the "ground truth" to test the software against.

For the validation strategy, see `../DOCS/VALIDATION.md`.
